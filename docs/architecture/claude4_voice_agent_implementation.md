# Claude 4 Voice Agent Implementation Specification
> Specification #001 - v1.0

## High-Level Objective

- Create a production-ready Claude 4 voice agent system that handles enterprise phone calls up to 1 hour with ultra-low latency, extended thinking capabilities, and future-ready architecture

## Mid-Level Objectives

- Build Claude 4 integration with AWS Bedrock for voice conversations
- Implement extended thinking mode for complex problem-solving during calls
- Create hybrid edge-cloud architecture for <100ms global latency
- Integrate Deepgram Nova-3 STT and Aura-2 TTS for natural conversations
- Design future-ready architecture for upcoming Bedrock features
- Ensure comprehensive monitoring and analytics

## Implementation Notes

- Use Elixir/Phoenix with Membrane Framework for audio processing
- Follow OTP supervision patterns for fault tolerance
- Leverage Cloudflare Workers for edge processing
- Use AWS Bedrock Converse API for Claude 4 integration
- Implement prompt caching for 90% cost reduction
- Design for billion-scale concurrent operations
- Ensure all enterprise compliance requirements (SOC 2, HIPAA, GDPR, CCPA, PCI DSS)

## Low-Level Tasks
> Ordered from start to finish

1. Create Bedrock client for Claude 4 integration
```claude
CREATE apps/voice_agent/lib/voice_agent/bedrock_client.ex:
    IMPLEMENT GenServer for AWS Bedrock communication:
        Configure Claude 4 model IDs (opus-4, sonnet-4)
        Implement Converse API with streaming support
        Add connection pooling for high concurrency
        Handle rate limiting and retries
        Implement telemetry events for monitoring
```

2. Implement Claude handler for voice conversations
```claude
CREATE apps/voice_agent/lib/voice_agent/claude_handler.ex:
    IMPLEMENT GenServer for Claude 4 conversation handling:
        Process streaming audio transcripts in real-time
        Manage conversation context and state
        Handle interruptions and turn-taking
        Implement natural pauses and filler words
        Add emotion and tone control
```

3. Create extended thinking mode manager
```claude
CREATE apps/voice_agent/lib/voice_agent/thinking_mode.ex:
    IMPLEMENT thinking mode for complex reasoning:
        Manage thinking token budgets (1024-64000)
        Enable tool use during thinking
        Implement thinking time estimation
        Add voice feedback during thinking ("Let me think about that...")
        Handle thinking interruption gracefully
```

4. Build conversation manager with context handling
```claude
CREATE apps/voice_agent/lib/voice_agent/conversation_manager.ex:
    IMPLEMENT conversation state management:
        Track conversation flow and turn-taking
        Manage interruption detection and handling
        Implement context window optimization
        Add conversation history tracking
        Handle call duration limits (max 1 hour)
```

5. Create prompt caching system
```claude
CREATE apps/voice_agent/lib/voice_agent/prompt_cache.ex:
    IMPLEMENT ETS-based prompt caching:
        Cache system prompts and templates
        Implement cache key generation
        Add TTL-based expiration
        Track cache hit rates
        Enable 90% cost reduction through caching
```

6. Update voice pipeline for Claude 4 integration
```claude
UPDATE apps/voice_pipeline/lib/voice_pipeline/membrane/pipeline.ex:
    MODIFY pipeline to integrate Claude 4:
        Add Claude handler to processing chain
        Implement parallel STT/LLM/TTS processing
        Configure for <100ms end-to-end latency
        Add monitoring taps for analytics
```

7. Enhance audio processor for voice agent features
```claude
UPDATE apps/voice_pipeline/lib/voice_pipeline/audio_processor.ex:
    ADD voice agent specific processing:
        Implement advanced VAD for turn detection
        Add prosody analysis for emotion detection
        Enhance echo cancellation
