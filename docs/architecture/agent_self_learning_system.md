- Create knowledge synthesis engine that generates reusable conversation strategies
- Design A/B testing framework for validating improvements
- Develop error prevention system that ensures mistakes never repeat
- Build collective intelligence sharing across all agents

## Implementation Notes

- Use Claude 4's extended thinking for deep pattern analysis
- Implement versioned learning artifacts for rollback capability
- Design for privacy-first learning (no PII in patterns)
- Create gradual rollout mechanism for behavior changes
- Ensure all learning respects compliance requirements
- Build feedback loops for continuous validation
- Design for future integration with AWS Bedrock's learning features
