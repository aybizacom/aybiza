# Agent Memory Architecture Implementation Specification
> Specification #003 - v1.0

## High-Level Objective

- Create a comprehensive memory system that enables voice agents to maintain context across calls, learn from interactions, and provide personalized experiences while remaining future-ready for AWS Bedrock Memory integration

## Mid-Level Objectives

- Build dual-layer memory system with Redis (short-term) and DynamoDB (long-term)
- Implement per-customer and per-agent memory patterns
- Create memory synthesis for agent self-improvement
- Design memory retrieval optimized for real-time voice conversations
- Build privacy-compliant memory management with retention policies
- Ensure seamless future migration to Bedrock Memory when available

## Implementation Notes

- Use Redis for sub-5ms memory access during active calls
- Use DynamoDB for persistent memory with global tables
- Implement memory versioning and schema evolution
- Follow GDPR/CCPA requirements for data retention and deletion
- Design memory format compatible with future Bedrock Memory API
- Implement memory compression and optimization
- Create memory analytics for continuous improvement
