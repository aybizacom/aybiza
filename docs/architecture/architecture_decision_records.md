# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This document contains the Architecture Decision Records for the AYBIZA platform's hybrid Cloudflare+AWS architecture with Claude 3.7 Sonnet integration.

## ADR 1: Elixir/Erlang as Primary Technology Stack

### Status: Accepted

### Context
We need a technology stack that can handle real-time voice processing with ultra-low latency (<50ms US/UK, <100ms globally) at massive scale through hybrid Cloudflare+AWS architecture, while maintaining high reliability and fault tolerance with Claude 3.7 Sonnet integration.

### Decision
We will use Elixir 1.18.3/OTP 27.3.4 as our primary technology stack for the AYBIZA platform's hybrid architecture, optimized for edge processing and Claude 3.7 Sonnet integration.

### Consequences
- **Positive**:
  - Lightweight process model enables millions of concurrent connections across 300+ edge locations
  - Fault tolerance through OTP supervision trees with hybrid failover
  - Hot code reloading for zero-downtime deployments across edge and cloud
  - Functional programming paradigm reduces state-related bugs in distributed systems
  - Pattern matching simplifies error handling in multi-region deployments
  - Excellent performance for real-time voice processing with <50ms latency targets
  - Native support for distributed systems and edge computing patterns
  
- **Negative**:
  - Smaller talent pool compared to more mainstream languages
  - Learning curve for developers unfamiliar with Elixir/Erlang
  - Limited ecosystem for some specialized libraries

## ADR 2: Umbrella Project Structure

### Status: Accepted

### Context
The AYBIZA platform consists of multiple related but distinct components that need to be developed, tested, and deployed together.

### Decision
We will structure the project as an Elixir umbrella application with separate apps for each major functional area.

### Consequences
- **Positive**:
  - Clear separation of concerns
  - Independent testing of components
  - Ability to deploy components separately if needed
  - Shared configuration and dependencies
  
- **Negative**:
  - More complex project structure
  - Potential for circular dependencies if not carefully managed
  - Overhead in managing multiple applications

## ADR 3: Direct API Integration vs SDKs

### Status: Accepted

### Context
We need to integrate with multiple third-party services (Twilio, Deepgram, AWS) that offer both API access and language-specific SDKs.

### Decision
We will implement direct API integrations rather than using third-party SDKs wherever possible.

### Consequences
- **Positive**:
  - Complete control over request/response handling
  - No dependency on SDK maintenance by third parties
  - Ability to optimize for our specific use cases
  - Simplified deployment without additional language runtimes
  
- **Negative**:
  - More work to implement API integrations from scratch
  - Need to keep up with API changes manually
  - Missing convenience features provided by SDKs

## ADR 4: Membrane Framework for Media Processing

### Status: Accepted

### Context
We need a framework for processing audio streams that can handle real-time requirements with minimal latency.

### Decision
We will use the Membrane Framework for audio processing in our voice pipeline.

### Consequences
- **Positive**:
  - Elixir-native solution for multimedia processing
  - Optimized for low-latency streaming
  - Component-based architecture for easy pipeline construction
  - Active development and maintenance
  
- **Negative**:
  - Relatively new framework with smaller community
  - Less documentation and examples compared to alternatives
  - May require custom components for specialized needs

## ADR 5: AWS as Primary Cloud Provider

### Status: Accepted

### Context
We need a cloud infrastructure provider that can support our scalability, security, and compliance requirements.

### Decision
We will use AWS as our primary cloud provider, with specific services selected based on our requirements.

### Consequences
- **Positive**:
  - Comprehensive set of services for all our needs
  - Strong security and compliance capabilities
  - Global presence for low-latency deployments
  - Advanced AI/ML services including Bedrock for LLM integration
  
- **Negative**:
  - Higher costs compared to some alternatives
  - Vendor lock-in concerns
  - Complexity in service configuration and management

## ADR 6: TimescaleDB for Time-Series Data

### Status: Accepted

### Context
We need to store and analyze large volumes of time-series metrics data from call processing.

### Decision
We will use TimescaleDB as an extension to PostgreSQL for handling time-series data.

### Consequences
- **Positive**:
  - Specialized for time-series data with high ingestion rates
  - Seamless integration with PostgreSQL
  - Efficient querying and aggregation of time-series data
  - Advanced features like continuous aggregates and retention policies
  
- **Negative**:
  - Additional complexity in database management
  - Specific optimization requirements
  - Deployment considerations for high-availability setups

## ADR 7: GenStateMachine for Conversation Management

### Status: Accepted

### Context
We need to manage complex conversation flows with multiple states and transitions.

### Decision
We will use GenStateMachine for implementing the conversation state management.

### Consequences
- **Positive**:
  - Formal state machine implementation with clear transitions
  - Built on top of OTP behaviors for reliability
  - Explicit modeling of conversation states
  - Support for state data and event handling
  
- **Negative**:
  - More verbose than simpler approaches
  - Learning curve for developers unfamiliar with state machines
  - Potential for complex state explosion without careful design

## ADR 8: AWS Bedrock for LLM Integration

### Status: Accepted

### Context
We need to integrate with large language models for natural conversation handling.

### Decision
We will use AWS Bedrock as our primary LLM integration, with support for Claude models.

### Consequences
- **Positive**:
  - Seamless integration with other AWS services
  - Access to state-of-the-art models like Claude
  - Enterprise-grade security and compliance
  - Simplified billing and account management
  
- **Negative**:
  - AWS-specific implementation
  - Higher latency compared to direct API access
  - Limited control over model parameters
  - Dependency on AWS service availability

## ADR 9: Docker for Containerization

### Status: Accepted

### Context
We need a consistent environment for development, testing, and production deployment.

### Decision
We will use Docker for containerizing the application and its dependencies.

### Consequences
- **Positive**:
  - Consistent environment across development and production
  - Simplified dependency management
  - Easy scaling with container orchestration
  - Isolated components for security
  
- **Negative**:
  - Additional complexity in configuration
  - Performance overhead (minimal)
  - Learning curve for Docker best practices
  - Storage management for container images

## ADR 10: GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration and Deployment

### Status: Accepted

### Context
We need an automated pipeline for testing, building, and deploying the application.

### Decision
We will use GitHub Actions for our continuous integration and deployment pipeline.

### Consequences
- **Positive**:
  - Tight integration with GitHub repository
  - Pipeline as code with workflow YAML files
  - Rich ecosystem of actions and integrations
  - Good support for Docker-based workflows
  
- **Negative**:
  - Limited to GitHub platform
