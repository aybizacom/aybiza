# Specification Development Guide for Claude Code Integration

## Overview

This guide provides a structured approach to creating effective specifications for developing AYBIZA components using Claude Code. Following this methodology ensures consistent, high-quality implementations that align with architectural principles while leveraging the power of AI-assisted development.

## Why Specifications Matter

Well-crafted specifications serve multiple purposes:

1. **Clear Direction**: Provides unambiguous requirements that Claude Code can interpret correctly
2. **Consistent Structure**: Ensures all team members follow the same development patterns
3. **Implementation Efficiency**: Facilitates rapid, accurate code generation
4. **Documentation**: Serves as living documentation of system components
5. **Quality Assurance**: Creates a reference point for validation and testing

## Specification Structure

Each specification document should follow this standardized structure:

### 1. Title and Identification

```markdown
# [Feature Name] Specification
> Specification #[Number] - v[Version]
```

### 2. High-Level Objective

A concise statement of the overall goal, written as a single bullet point:

```markdown
## High-Level Objective

- Create a [specific feature] that enables [specific capability]
```

### 3. Mid-Level Objectives

A breakdown of the high-level objective into concrete, measurable steps:

```markdown
## Mid-Level Objectives

- Build a [specific component] with [specific behavior]
- Implement [specific functionality] for [specific purpose]
- Integrate with [existing system component]
- Ensure comprehensive test coverage
```

### 4. Implementation Notes

Technical details, constraints, and standards that guide implementation:

```markdown
## Implementation Notes

- Use [specific technologies/frameworks]
- Follow [specific coding standards]
- Ensure compatibility with [specific systems]
- Performance requirements: [specific metrics]
- Security considerations: [specific requirements]
```

### 5. Context

Define the starting point and ending state of the codebase:

```markdown
## Context

### Beginning Context
- `path/to/existing/file1.ext`
- `path/to/existing/file2.ext`

### Ending Context
- `path/to/existing/file1.ext` (modified)
- `path/to/existing/file2.ext` (modified)
- `path/to/new/file3.ext` (new)
```

### 6. Low-Level Tasks

Detailed, sequential steps for implementation, formatted for Claude Code:

```markdown
## Low-Level Tasks
> Ordered from start to finish

1. [First task description]
```claude
UPDATE path/to/file.ext:
    CREATE/UPDATE function_name():
        Implement specific functionality
        Handle specific edge cases
```

2. [Second task description]
```claude
CREATE path/to/new/file.ext:
    IMPLEMENT specific_class:
        Add required methods
        Ensure proper error handling
```
```

## Integration with Claude Code

This section explains how to use these specifications with Claude Code for efficient implementation.

### Step 1: Create a Specification

Follow the structure above to create a complete specification document. Save it with the next available number following the established AYBIZA documentation convention (e.g., `39_feature_name_specification.md`).

### Step 2: Implement with Claude Code

1. Start Claude Code in your development environment:
   ```bash
   claude
   ```

2. Present the specification:
   ```
   I'd like to implement this specification: [paste specification or provide file path]
   ```

3. Guide Claude through the implementation process:
   ```
   Please review this specification and implement it step by step, starting with the first low-level task.
   ```

### Step 3: Validation and Testing

After Claude completes the implementation:

1. Run all tests to verify functionality:
   ```
   Please run the appropriate tests to verify this implementation.
   ```

2. Review code quality:
   ```
   Please review the code for adherence to our coding standards, potential edge cases, and performance considerations.
   ```

## Implementing a Complete Project with Specifications

For larger projects requiring multiple specifications:

### 1. Create a Project Plan

Start by developing a high-level project plan that identifies major components and their relationships:

```markdown
# Project Implementation Plan

## Components
1. Component A - [Brief description]
2. Component B - [Brief description]
3. Component C - [Brief description]

## Implementation Order
1. Specification #40: Component A
2. Specification #41: Component B
3. Specification #42: Component C

## Integration Points
- Component A provides [specific interface] for Component B
- Component B provides [specific data] for Component C
```

### 2. Develop Individual Specifications

Create a separate specification document for each component following the structure outlined in this guide.

### 3. Implement Sequentially

Implement each specification in the defined order, ensuring that dependencies are satisfied:

1. Implement Specification #40
2. Validate and test
3. Implement Specification #41
4. Validate and test
5. Implement Specification #42
6. Validate and test

### 4. Final Integration Testing

After all components are implemented, perform comprehensive integration testing:

```markdown
# Integration Test Plan

## Test Scenarios
1. [Scenario 1 description]
2. [Scenario 2 description]
3. [Scenario 3 description]

## Expected Results
1. [Expected result 1]
2. [Expected result 2]
3. [Expected result 3]
```

## Using Claude Code Advanced Features for Implementation

When implementing specifications with Claude Code, leverage these advanced features for optimal results:

### Extended Thinking

For complex design decisions, prompt Claude to engage extended thinking:

```
Please think about the best approach for implementing [specific component] considering [specific requirements].
```

### Multi-Claude Workflows

For larger specifications, consider using multiple Claude instances in parallel:

1. One instance to implement code
2. Another to write tests
3. A third to review and suggest improvements

### Visual Feedback

For UI components, use screenshots and visual references:

```
Here's a mockup of the desired UI. Please implement the HTML and CSS to match this design.
[paste or link to image]
```

### Context Engineering with CLAUDE.md

Create a CLAUDE.md file in your project root with important implementation details:

```markdown
# Project Guidelines

## Coding Standards
- [List of coding standards]

## Common Patterns
- [List of common patterns]

## Important Commands
- [List of important commands]
```

## Conclusion

This specification development guide provides a structured approach to creating clear, actionable specifications that leverage Claude Code's capabilities. By following this methodology, you can ensure consistent, high-quality implementations that align with AYBIZA's architectural principles and quality standards.

When creating specifications, remember:
- Start with clear objectives
- Provide detailed context
- Break down into explicit tasks
- Format for optimal Claude Code interpretation
- Include validation requirements

The resulting code will be consistent, maintainable, and aligned with project requirements.
