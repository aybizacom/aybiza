# Claude 4 Parallel Tool Execution Implementation Specification
> Specification #004 - v1.0

## High-Level Objective

- Create a parallel tool execution system that leverages Claude 4's ability to call multiple tools simultaneously, optimizing voice agent response times and enabling complex multi-step operations during conversations

## Mid-Level Objectives

- Implement parallel tool orchestration with AWS Bedrock Converse API
- Build intelligent dependency resolution for tool execution order
- Create result aggregation and conflict resolution mechanisms
- Optimize for voice conversation latency requirements
- Design error handling for partial failures in parallel execution
- Enable tool execution monitoring and analytics

## Implementation Notes

- Use AWS Bedrock Converse API's parallel tool calling feature
- Implement with Elixir's Task.async_stream for local parallelism
- Design for up to 10 parallel tool executions
- Maintain conversation flow during parallel operations
- Implement smart fallback for sequential execution when needed
- Ensure all tool executions are audit logged
- Follow voice UX patterns for progress indication

## Parallel Execution Examples

```elixir
# Claude 4 parallel tool request
%ParallelToolRequest{
  tools: [
    %{name: "check_calendar", params: %{date: "2025-05-25"}},
    %{name: "search_contacts", params: %{name: "John Smith"}},
    %{name: "get_weather", params: %{location: "New York"}}
  ],
  execution_strategy: :parallel_optimized,
  timeout: 3000
}

# Execution plan
%ExecutionPlan{
  parallel_groups: [
    # Group 1 - All independent, execute in parallel
    [
      {:check_calendar, estimated_ms: 200},
      {:search_contacts, estimated_ms: 150},
      {:get_weather, estimated_ms: 100}
    ]
  ],
  total_estimated_ms: 200, # Max of parallel group
  voice_feedback: "Let me check your calendar, contacts, and weather simultaneously..."
}

# Complex example with dependencies
%ParallelToolRequest{
  tools: [
    %{name: "find_contact", params: %{email: "john@example.com"}},
    %{name: "check_crm", params: %{contact_id: "$find_contact.id"}},
    %{name: "check_calendar", params: %{attendee: "$find_contact.email"}},
    %{name: "send_invite", params: %{
      contact_id: "$find_contact.id",
      calendar_slot: "$check_calendar.available_slot"
    }}
  ]
}

# Resulting execution plan
%ExecutionPlan{
  parallel_groups: [
    # Group 1 - Find contact first
    [{:find_contact, estimated_ms: 150}],
    # Group 2 - Check CRM and calendar in parallel
    [
      {:check_crm, estimated_ms: 200},
      {:check_calendar, estimated_ms: 250}
    ],
    # Group 3 - Send invite after dependencies resolved
    [{:send_invite, estimated_ms: 100}]
  ],
  total_estimated_ms: 500,
  voice_feedback: "I'll look up the contact and check both your calendar and CRM records..."
}
```
